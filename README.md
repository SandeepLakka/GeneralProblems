# GeneralProblems

This repo is for coding problems meant for mental exercise and also can be used to refresh basic OCA/OCP and algorithms concepts.

#### Need To Know
* Java 8 for implementation and Junit5 for tests

* Each problem is coded in a seperate class and a corresponding test class contains general as well as corner cases

* Each coding problem can be solved in multiple ways. Implementations in this repositories might later changed (either through refactoring/new method)
